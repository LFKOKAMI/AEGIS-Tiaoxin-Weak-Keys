The code is used to verify our attacks on reduced Tiaoxin and AEGIS in the weak-key setting.

When you run the code, you are required to choose a command for different tests, as below:

1 -> Test the wrong integral property on real aes round function (time-consuming)

2 -> verify the correct integral property on small-scale aes round function

3 -> 8-round distinguisher for Tiaoxin

4 -> key recovery for 8-round Tiaoxin with weak constants

5 -> 5-round distinguisher for AEGIS

6 -> 5-round key-recovery for AEGIS

Commands 1 and 2 are related to the part discussed in appendix.
